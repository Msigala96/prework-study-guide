# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created as a prework project in order to make sure that when the semester starts, I can have a basic understanding of the curriculum.
 I was motivated to create this webpage because, the skills that I am learning will be what I base my whole career around. I built this project in order have a proper viewpoint of each of the subjects that assemble a simple webpage and through the process, I am now able to see the many ways that we can deploy content on to a webpage with the basic fundamentals necesarry.
